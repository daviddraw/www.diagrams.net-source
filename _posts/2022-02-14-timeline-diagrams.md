Timelines, roadmap and milestone diagrams feature in a range of documentation - project development documents, infographics and presentations being some of the most common. There are many shapes and templates in draw.io and our draw.io branded apps that you can use to quickly draw an attractive diagram that you can embed in your presentation or documentation.

## Use the Infographic shape library

While you can create a timeline from many of the shapes in the basic libraries, as with the example above, the _Infographic_ shape library has a selection of ready-made roadmaps and timelines.

**Enable the Infographic shape library**

1. In the left-hand panel of the draw.io editor, click _More Shapes_.
2. Scroll to _Other_ section, click on the checkbox next to the _Infographic_ shape library, then click _Apply_.

Most items in the infographic shape library are a collection of shapes and labels already styled and arranged neatly, just like a template.

**Draw and edit your timeline**
1. Hover over a shape in the library to see a larger preview. 
2. Click on a shape to add it to the drawing canvas.
3. Double click on the text to edit the labels.
4. Change the shape and text styles via the format panel on the right if needed.
5. Copy and paste parts of the diagram on the drawing canvas or drag the matching component shapes from the _Infographic_ shape library to extend your timeline as needed. 

**Horizontal timelines and roadmaps using Infographic shapes**

There are two _horizontal roadmaps_ with different styles, as well as a _bar graph_ that are well suited to use as a timeline or milestone diagram in a presentation or when planning projects using [draw.io as your team's online whiteboard](/blog/sketch-online-whiteboard.html).

Some others in the Infographic library that work well as a horizontal timeline when you edit their label text include the following: _list_, _circular dial list_, _percentage list_ and the _roll_.

**Tip:** For a more detailed timeline with multiple text boxes for each time step, use the _Chevron list_ shapes.

**Vertical timelines and roadmap shapes**

If you need to print a document or use it as part of a larger infographic, your timeline may be more readable when vertical. The _vertical roadmaps_, _numbered lists_, and _swirl_ shapes, along with the various _angled_ and _arrow lists_ are well suited for printed documentation.

## Use a template

There are also several timeline and roadmap templates in the _Business_ section of the template library. 

1. Open a new diagram to see the [template library](/blog/template-diagrams.html), or select _Arrange > Insert > Template_ in the draw.io editor.
2. Select the _Business_ section on the left, and scroll to the bottom of the the section. Click on the magnifying glass to see a larger preview of any template.

3. Select a template, then click _Insert_ to add it to the drawing canvas. 

## Embed your timeline in your presentation or document

There are many integrations of draw.io. Those which JGraph develops are branded draw.io. These apps and add-ons work in a range of platforms - Google, Microsoft, Atlassian and more.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/integrations.png" style="width=100%;max-width:500px;;height:auto;" alt="There is a large ecosystem of draw.io apps and integrations for diagramming in whichever platform or app you are using for documentation">

When you store your diagram file in your Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive account, you can embed your diagram into Microsoft Office and Google Workplace documents easily - presentations, documents and spreadsheets - using the draw.io addins for those platforms. 

For example, when you have installed the draw.io addin in Word (Office 365 online), with the Ribbon expanded, there are multiple draw.io options: 
* insert a diagram from oneDrive
* update a selected or all diagrams 
* open the selected diagram in another window to edit it in [our online editor](/https://app.diagrams.net).
