You can use diagrams in many ways in retail, including to visualise customer shopping data, to plan customer journeys, to analyse and optimise your retail space, and to improve workflows for both customers and co-workers.

Bend connectors around a [floor plan](/blog/floorplans.html) to visualise the main **paths customers take** through your store. 

Indicate **best and worst sellers** with hotspots on [different layers](/doc/layers.html) to visualise sales performance against shelf and floor plan positions.

Link each shelf to a **planogram** on [another diagram page](/blog/multiple-page-diagrams.html) - it is easier to analyse sales performance when you keep the visualisations together in one diagram file. Drop photos and product images into a [container table](/blog/tables.html) to draw an easy planogram of a shelf or window display. 
 
As draw.io comes with a wide range of shape libraries built-in, you don't need multiple specialised diagramming tools to draw many different types of diagrams. 

## Show customer foot traffic on a floor plan

Click on _More Shapes_ at the bottom of the shapes panel and enable the _Floorplans_ shape library. Use these shapes to map out your retail space.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/floorplans-shape-library.png" alt="Enable the Floorplans shape library in diagram.net" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" >

Now you can bend a curved connector to follow the path that customers typically take through your store. 

1. Connect the entrance with the checkout.
2. Set the curved connector style via the Style tab in the format panel. Set the connector _Waypoints_ to straight.

1. Drag the waypoints of the connector until the connector follows the path your customers take. You can even drag connectors into loops.

### Use layers to organise visual information

Keep your floor plan separate from customer paths and sales data by using layers. This will let you add multiple customer paths more easily. 

**Enable the Layers dialog:** Click on _View_ in the toolbar and enable _Layers_.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/retail-diagrams-view-layers.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Use layers to organise the information in your retail diagrams">

**Work with layers:** Use the layers dialog to add, rename and organise your diagram's layers.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/retail-diagrams-layers-light.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Use layers to organise the information in your retail diagrams">
* Click _+_ at the bottom of the Layers dialog to add a new layer. 
* Double click on the name of a layer to edit and rename the layer. 
* Drag a layer up or down the list to move it above or below another layer. 
* Click on the _eye_ icon to the left of the layer name to hide or show that layer.
* Click on the _lock_ icon to ensure no changes can be made to that layer. A locked layer's name will be shown in red.

**Add shapes to a layer:** Make sure you select the layer you want to add a shape or connector to - the currently selected layer is indicated with bold text and a different background colour (blue in light mode, grey in dark mode). 

For example, the _customer path_ layer has been selected in the dark mode screenshot below.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/retail-diagrams-layers-dark.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Use layers to organise the information in your retail diagrams">

When you select a shape, a dot will appear to the right of the layer it is on. Note that you can select shapes that are on other layers - for example, the selected green hotspot in the screenshot below is on the _sales_ layer, but currently the _floor plan_ layer is selected.

**Move shapes to another layer:** Select shapes and connectors, then click the vertical dots and select the target layer to move them.

## Draw a planogram of a shelf or display

**Add the shelf as a _container table_** 

Click on the [table tool](/blog/tables.html), enable the _Container_ checkbox and click on grid below at the position that matches the number of shelves vertically, and maximum variety of products horizontally.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/retail-planogram-add-table.png" style="width=100%;max-width:200px;height:auto;" alt="Add a container table to the drawing canvas in draw.io to draw a planogram">

**Get rid of the _title_ rows and columns** 

Click on a table cell and drag the orange diamond on the title separator line to the outer edge of the table so it disappears. Do this once for the horizontal title line and the vertical title line.

**Add products to the planogram shelves** 

Drag a photo of a product or group of products from your computer and drop it into a table cell when it is highlighted in purple. 

Alternatively, mock-up products with appropriate colours and shapes from the draw.io shape libraries. You can [search for shapes](/doc/faq/shape-search.html), use shapes from the _Infographic_ and other shape libraries to represent products.
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/retail-planogram-table-cell.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Drop products into the container table cells draw a retail planogram in draw.io">

**Add hotspots to planograms to indicate sales performance**

1. Click _View_ in the toolbar and open the _Layers_ dialog. 
2. Add a new layer and make sure it is selected.
3. Drag circles from the shape library onto the best and worst sellers. 
4. Use the _Gradient_ style with a dark and a light value of the same colour. Disable the _Line_ outline on the shape to make it appear like a hotspot.

### Link a shelf in the retail floorplan to a planograms

Right-click on the shelf in the floorplan and select _Edit Link_. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/retail-floorplan-edit-link.png" style="width=100%;max-width:400px;height:auto;" alt="Link your floorplan shelves to their planograms to make your retail diagrams easy to navigate in draw.io">

Select the diagram page containing that shelf's planogram from the drop down list and click _OK_.

**Navigate to the planogram from the floorplan**

On an unlocked layer, click on the shelf shape to see a link appear in the tooltip below. Click on the link to jump to that page. 

On a locked layer, the mouse pointer will change to indicate it is a link when you hover over the shelf shape. Click on the shelf to jump to that diagram page.
