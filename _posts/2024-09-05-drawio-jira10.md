Atlassian has recently released Jira Software 10.0 and Data Center Platform 7, which includes a large collection of security and automation improvements. The draw.io app has been updated to support Jira Software 10.0 and its long awaited dark theme - your diagrams will switch to dark mode automatically to match your Jira user settings.

**Important**

If you are planning to [upgrade to Jira 10.0](https://confluence.atlassian.com/jirasoftware/jira-software-10-0-x-release-notes-1416825224.html), Atlassian recommends you update all Marketplace apps that support the new version - like draw.io does - beforehand. 

## Dark theme Jira issues and diagrams 

1. In Jira, click on your user profile image in the top right, then select _Theme_.
2. Choose Dark theme, Light theme, or to _Match System_ to match your operating system's theme.

To add a new diagram to a Jira issue, click on _More > Add draw.io Diagram_ to open the draw.io editor.

Once you have saved your diagram to the issue, the _Draw.io Diagrams_ section will be added in the right column. 

Diagrams in the _Draw.io Diagrams_ section will be displayed in whichever theme you selected in Jira automatically. 

**Note:** The draw.io diagram in the _Attachments_ section of the Jira issue is saved and shown as if it were light mode. To edit or open a larger version of the diagram, click on the diagram in the _Draw.io Diagrams_ section of the issue. 

Hover over the diagram and click on the edit pencil to open it in the draw.io editor.
