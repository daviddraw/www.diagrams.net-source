Companies want complete control over their content and data when using cloud platforms. Atlassian's secure-by-design Forge development platform enables and enforces isolation - with zero-egress apps like draw.io, none of your data ever leaves your Atlassian cloud environment. 

## What is Forge?

Forge is Atlassian's cloud app development platform that provides apps with a bridge to securely integrate with Atlassian's products and secure storage with data residency features, amongst other front end and backend tools. 

Most importantly, the Forge app hosting platform (Forge runtime) runs draw.io and other Forge apps inside a security layer that enforces tenancy isolation and restricts data egress by design.

## draw.io is both a Forge app and Cloud Fortified

To be Cloud Fortified, [draw.io has passed Atlassian's additional requirements](/blog/drawio-atlassian-cloud-fortified.html) for enterprise-grade apps that provide consistent reliability and support, on top of strict security requirements. 

With Forge additionally guaranteeing data residency regions and zero-egress of data outside your Atlassian Confluence Cloud or Jira Cloud instance, draw.io keeps your technical diagrams confidential and secure. 

Your sensitive diagram data and content never leaves your Atlassian cloud infrastructure when you use Forge apps with zero egress, allowing you comply with a number of data protection certifications (ISO 27000, 27001 and 27002) and the GDPR, amongst others.

If you need to document sensitive business processes, systems, or technical designs in secrecy, manage security risks, and meet strict data protection or security certification requirements, the draw.io apps for Confluence and Jira provide you with all the tools and shapes you need to draw a wide variety of technical diagrams.
