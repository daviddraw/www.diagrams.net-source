When you create a new diagram with the [draw.io web editor](https://app.diagrams.net), you can now choose to use our new smart diagram generator instead of one of our existing templates. Describe your diagram in a text phrase, and the tool will generate a diagram based on what it parses. For example, this entity relationship model was generated from the phrase "a customer purchases a product from a web store".

As these smart generated template diagrams have not been vetted by a human, there are no guarantees it will useful as a template for your particular diagram. But the generated diagram can serve as inspiration, or a starting point from which you can draw the diagram you actually need.

**Tip:** You can generate endless variations of a diagram from the same phrase.

## Generate a diagram in draw.io

1. Create a new diagram - go to [our online diagram editor](https://app.diagrams.net) - or click on ``+`` in the toolbar and select _Template_ to insert a generated diagram.
2. Click on the _Generate_ box in the template library. 
3. Enter a basic description of your diagram in the text field, and press ``Enter`` or click _OK_.
4. Click _Insert_ or _Create_ to add it to the drawing canvas.

Alternatively, you can choose different types of diagrams and see different generated variations of the diagram in the _Smart Templates_ section. 
1. Create a new diagram - go to [our online diagram editor](https://app.diagrams.net) - or click on ``+`` in the toolbar and select _Template_ to insert a generated diagram.
2. Go to the _Smart Templates_ section on the left of the template library.

1. Select the diagram type that you want to generate from the drop down list, then click _Generate_ and wait for the preview to appear.

1. Click _Generate_ again to generate a different diagram with the same phrase - you can do this as many times as you like. Here's the same prompt as a sequence diagram.

1. Click _Create_ if it's a new diagram, or _Insert_ if you are inserting a template.

**Tip:** Click on the magnifying glass in the top right of the preview to see a larger version of the generated diagram before adding it to the drawing canvas. 

You can now edit, add to, delete, and style the shapes and connectors in the generated diagram.

## Different types of generated diagrams

Here are some different types of diagrams generated from the phrase "a customer purchases a product from a web store".

<img src="/assets/img/blog/diagram-generator-flow.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Generate a flowchart from a text description via the template library in draw.io"> 
<img src="/assets/img/blog/diagram-generator-state.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Generate a state diagram from a text description via the template library in draw.io">
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/diagram-generator-sequence.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Generate a UML sequence diagram from a text description via the template library in draw.io"> 
<img src="/assets/img/blog/diagram-generator-er.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Generate an entity relationship model from a text description via the template library in draw.io">

Of course, that phrase won't generate something useful for certain types of diagrams, like this Gantt chart. 
<br /><img src="/assets/img/blog/diagram-generator-gantt.png" style="width=100%;max-width:300px;height:auto;" alt="Generate a Gantt chart from a text description via the template library in draw.io">

And because the previous phrase makes no sense when describing a mindmap, here's "types of technical diagrams for IT workers".

### More ways to generate diagrams from text

In draw.io, there are many different ways to generate diagrams automatically from text.

* [PlantUML](/blog/plantuml.html) - class diagrams, state diagrams, activity diagrams, user diagrams, component diagrams and more. 
  
* [Mermaid](/blog/mermaid-diagrams.html) - all UML diagram types, as well as pie charts, flowcharts, organisation charts, Gantt charts and more. 
  
* [Entity diagrams](/blog/insert-sql.html) - from SQL code.
  
* [CSV data into diagrams](/blog/insert-from-csv.html) - with formatting information to create flowcharts, mindmaps, org charts, directed graphs and more.

## Troubleshooting generated diagrams

Some diagram types lend themselves more naturally to text descriptions. Flow charts, sequence diagrams and mind maps are easier to generate than git graphs from a text description. 

As this tool is not a human and can not know what is logical to include in a diagram, there are no guarantees you will generate a diagram that is fit for purpose.

This feature uses a third party service to parse your phrase, and it can get somewhat overloaded at times. 

* Click _Try Again_ if the generation tool times out.
  
* If the keywords in your phrase cannot be adequately parsed to generate a diagram, you may receive an "Diagram not found" error. Try another descriptive phrase and regenerate your diagram.
