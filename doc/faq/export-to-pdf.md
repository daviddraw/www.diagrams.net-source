When you export your diagram to a PDF file, you can include a copy of your diagram data. When you drop that file onto the draw.io editor, it will open your diagram for editing again. 

**Tip:** You can [crop the PDF to match the size of the diagram](/doc/faq/pdf-export-crop.html), rather than using your devices page size settings.

1. Click _File > Export As > PDF_.

2. Change the export settings to suit your requirements.
   * Select whether to include _All Pages_ in your multi-page diagram, the _Current Page_ or just the shapes and connectors that are currently selected (_Selection Only_).
   * If you are printing the just the current page or a selection, enable the _Crop_ checkbox to crop the generated PDF to fit your diagram.
   * Enable the checkboxes if you want a _Transparent Background_, or to include the _Grid_ of the drawing canvas. 
   * Leave the checkbox enabled to _Include a copy of my diagram_ to include diagram data in your PDF file, so you can open it again in the draw.io editor.

### PDF diagram export options

   * _All Pages_ - Export all pages of a multi-page diagram. 

   * _Pages_ - Export one or more diagram pages. The first diagram page is page 1.

   * _Current page_ - Include only the current diagram page in the PDF.

   * _Selection Only_ - Export only the selected shapes and connectors on the _Current page_.

   * _Page View_ - Fit one drawing canvas page to one PDF page.

   * _Crop_ - Crop the exported PDF pages to the diagram page's dimensions. 

   * _Fit to_ - Resize the diagram pages to fit to the number of sheet(s) across and/or sheets(s) down, where one sheet is a PDF page. This always maintains proportions. 

   * _Border Width_ - Add whitespace (in pixels) around the diagram's outer edge. 

   * _Zoom_ - Resize your diagram page by this percentage and position it in the top left of the PDF page. 

   * _Grid_ - Include the drawing canvas grid in the PDF page.

   * _Transparent Background_ - Change the diagram background to transparent. This removes a background colour, but will not remove a background image.

   * _Include a copy of my diagram_ - Load the exported PDF file back into the draw.io editor and continue editing your diagram. 
  <br />**Note:** This may not work if you export your diagram using Safari, and is not available in the Desktop application.
