The diagram editor grid is not included when you print a diagram. But you can include it when you [export a diagram](/doc/faq/export-diagram.html) to an image format or a [PDF file](/doc/faq/export-to-pdf.html). 

1. Select _File > Export as_, then select one of the image formats (_PNG_, _JPEG_, or _SVG_) or _PDF_.
2. Enable the _Grid_ checkbox in the export settings dialog, then click _Export_.

3. Enter a filename and download the exported file. The image file will include the grid, and a [background colour](/doc/faq/background-colour.html) or [background image](/doc/faq/background-image.html).
