Some languages require text to be input from right to left, such as Arabic, or vertical Japanese text. 

You can change the writing direction in draw.io to support this. 

1. Select the shape or text that you want to reformat - this may or may not have text already entered. 
2. Click on the _Text_ tab of the format panel.
