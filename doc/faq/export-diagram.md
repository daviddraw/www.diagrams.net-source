You can export your diagrams to various types of images, files of different types, and even encode your diagram into a URL. The type of file that you choose to export to will depend on how you want to use it.

* ``.drawio`` and ``.xml`` save file formats contain your full diagram, and can be opened in draw.io.
* ``.png``, ``.svg`` and ``.jpeg`` are image file formats that you can use in documents, presentation slides or on web pages.
* ``.webp`` is an image file format designed for small file sizes for web pages.
* ``.html`` creates HTML code which embeds your diagram on a web page.
* ``.pdf`` generates a PDF document.

[Compare embed and export formats and their requirements](/doc/faq/embed-formats-compare.html)

**Tip:** You can choose to embed the diagram data in PNG, SVG, and PDF files so that they can be opened in the draw.io editor as the diagram.

If you have set a [background colour](/doc/faq/background-colour.html) or [background image](/doc/faq/background-image.html), it will be included when you export your diagram.

## Export your diagram to an image

You can export the current drawing canvas to an image: PNG, JPEG or SVG. JPEG are most commonly used in web pages. PNG and SVG images are scalable (resizeable) and work well in documents and presentation slides. SVG images support [animated connectors](/doc/faq/connector-animate.html). 

1. Select _File > Export as_ (or just _Export As_ from the [Simple mode](/blog/change-editor-mode.html) menu) then choose the image format you want to generate - _PNG_, _JPEG_, _WebP_, or _SVG_.

1. Each image format will offer you slightly different options, see below for details. Select the options you want, then click _Export_.

**Tip:** If you want to [include the editor grid in your image](/doc/faq/export-with-grid.html), enable the _Grid_ checkbox.

**Export as a PNG**

PNGs are used in web pages, documents and presentation slides.
   * Change the [PNG export options](/doc/faq/export-to-png.html) to suit your requirements.
   * Enable the _Selection only_ checkbox to export just the selected shapes and connectors
   * Ensure _Include a copy of my diagram_ is enabled to be able to open your diagram and edit it when you import the PNG file to draw.io.

**Export as a JPEG**

JPEG image files cannot contain your diagram data - only an image version of the page you are exporting.
   * Change the [JPEG export options](/doc/faq/export-to-jpeg.html) to suit your requirements.
   * If you only want to export the shapes and connectors that are currently selected, enable the _Selection only_ checkbox.

**Export as a WebP**

WebP image files cannot contain your diagram data - only an image version of the page you are exporting.
   * Change the [WebP export options](/doc/faq/export-to-WebP.html) to suit your requirements.
   * If you only want to export the shapes and connectors that are currently selected, enable the _Selection only_ checkbox.

**Export as a SVG**

SVG images can include your diagram data, as well as any links you've added to shapes.

## Export to a PDF file

When you export your diagram to a PDF file, you can include a copy of your diagram data, so that when you drop that file onto the draw.io editor, it will open your diagram for editing.

## Export to HTML

You can embed a diagram in a web page or in any online platform that can render HTML.
